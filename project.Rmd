# Observatory of Rural Dynamics and Inequalities in South India

Coordinated by [Dr Isabelle Guérin](https://www.cessma.org/GUERIN-Isabelle) and [Dr Christophe J. Nordman](https://neemsis.hypotheses.org/team/christophe-jalil-nordman), the ODRIIS Observatory is housed by the research program “Household vulnerabilities, labour and socioeconomic dynamics” in the Social Departments of the French Institute of Pondicherry. 
ODRIIS aims to analyses how structural changes in contemporary India are reshaping the organisation of work, social hierarchies and household livelihoods.
The observatory combines different tools through a collection of projects to help understand these socio-economic changes under different lights.
We have been collecting quantitative panel data on households and individuals in rural South India via the NEEMSIS Survey. 
We also use a variety of socio-economic methods (financial diaries, village monographs, life stories, video documentaries, etc). 
Beyond the regional analysis, the ODRIIS Observatory intends to contribute to the theoretical renewal of the concepts of work, networks, skills, debt and financialisation.
