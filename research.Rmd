   + Using a panel dataset built from an original household survey carried out in 2016-17 and 2020-21 in rural South India, we analyse the relationship between personality traits (conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness) \& cognitive skills (Raven matrices, literacy and numeracy scores) and financial decision-making.
We focus on the recourse, the negotiation, and the management of debt.
We find that certain personality traits such as openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness are generally significantly associated with negotiating and managing debt. 
The magnitude and statistical significance of the association between personality traits and debt differs across castes (Dalit, non-Dalit) and sex.
These findings suggest the use of personality traits and cognitive skills for females as a way to overcome the weight of social identity in a rural caste-segmented patriarchal context.
