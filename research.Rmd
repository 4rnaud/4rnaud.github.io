title: "Research"
description: |
   My research mobilises statistical tools to analyse the financial behaviour, labour and cognition of households in rural South India. <br> 
   I pay particular attention to the quality of the data, the transparency of the analyses and the ethics of research more generally. <br>
   Also, I am involved in the [NEEMSIS](https://neemsis.hypotheses.org/) data collection.
