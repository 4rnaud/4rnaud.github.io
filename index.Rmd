### Welcome to my page!


I am a Ph.D. student at the Economics departement ([BSE]((https://www.bse.u-bordeaux.fr/))) of the University of Bordeaux in France, and affiliated to the the [French Institute of Pondicherry](https://www.ifpindia.org/) (IFP) in India.
I am also involved in the [Observatory of Rural Dynamics and Inequalities in South India](https://odriis.hypotheses.org) (ODRIIS).

I am in India until August 2023.

My main field of interest is development economics, and I work on topics related to household indebtedness, labour, and cognition.
