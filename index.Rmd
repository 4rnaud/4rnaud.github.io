  Hi! Welcome to my page!
  
  I am a Ph.D. Student at the Economics departement ([BSE](https://www.bse.u-bordeaux.fr/membres/arnaud-natal/)) of the University of Bordeaux in France. <img src="https://www.transnationalgiving.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/flag-round-250.png" width="20" height="20">

  I am also a Research Affiliate at French Institute of Pondicherry ([IFP](https://www.ifpindia.org/)) and at the Observatory on Rural Dynamics and Inequalities in South India ([ODRIIS](https://odriis.hypotheses.org/)).

  I am currently hosted at the IFP, in charge of ([NEEMSIS](https://neemsis.hypotheses.org/)) ...

  My fields of specialization are development economics, household finance, and behavioural economics. Within these fields, I have three areas of interest: (i) household and individual indebtedness; (ii) cognitive skills and personality traits; and (iii) marriage market. I use both quantitative and qualitative data in my research. My work focuses mainly on India.
