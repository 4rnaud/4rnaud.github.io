### Hi! Welcome to my page!


I am a Ph.D. Student at the Economics departement ([BSE]((https://www.bse.u-bordeaux.fr/))) of the University of Bordeaux in France, and affiliated to the the [French Institute of Pondicherry](https://www.ifpindia.org/) (IFP) in India, through the [Observatory of Rural Dynamics and Inequalities in South India](https://odriis.hypotheses.org/) (ODRIIS).
I am involved in the development of the [NEEMSIS](https://neemsis.hypotheses.org) longitudinal survey since 2019.

I am currently in India until August 2023.

My main field of interest is Development Economics, and I work on topics related to household indebtedness, labour market, and cognitive skills/personality traits in rural South India, using the [RUME](https://odriis.hypotheses.org/projects/data/rume) and [NEEMSIS](https://neemsis.hypotheses.org) datasets.
